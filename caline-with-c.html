              <p>Direct from the Hague (via Vilnius, Lithuania) comes your new favorite darkwave artist - Caline With C. This alias was created for the reason of experimentation, as a free space for exploration of the unknown, both in the outside world and within. Emotional experience (which often works as a strong drive and motivation to the artist) and soundwave are the main focuses for Caline with C (aka Kamile), now studying Sonology in a master program.</br>
              In her own words: “I am a DJ, composer, performer, researcher and basically open to any kind of mentally, emotionally and acoustically stimulating activities. All my world turns around sound. I believe that “in the beginning, there was sound…”, therefore learning to talk and understand the language of sound has been a true delight.” This ethos comes across in the clear experimental versus intuitive approach at play on “Once in a Blue Moon”, with tracks that were recorded approximately over a period of one year. Her influences vary widely from musique concrète, industrial, bass, hip hop to dub, breakbeat, house, techno. The resultant 5 pieces move from ambient through darkwave, footwerk and bass with motifs of funky percussive house scattered throughout (courtesy of Kamile’s beloved Quasimidi Rave-o-lution 309), and is a pleasure for lovers of sonic experimentation.</p>

            Caline with C is a musician, composer and a DJ. Her artistic expressions varies from live sets to productions to sound programming sessions to DJ sets.</br>
            Caline with C is a project created for exploration of self and the surrounding world. The artist behind the project, Kamile Rimkute, finished Sonology studies in the Royal Conservatory in the Hague and is overall interested in an experimental and playful approach towards music and sound. Which, in her case, narrows down to a continuous dialogue between how it is “supposed to sound” and what does it mean to “make a mistake”. She challenges and consciously confuses her listeners in order to draw the attention to what they are actually hearing. At the same time Caline with C makes her music accessible for a wider audience and invite people to explore new and different ways of listening to sound. Through an intricate exchange between analog synthesizers, programming languages and software, productions come to existence with rhythmical structures that satisfy the body and sounds that let the mind wonder.</br>
            Kamile started to DJ and make music around 2016. She played in different radio stations worldwide, such as NTS radio (UK), Rinse FM France, ROOT radio (TR), TEST FM (RU), Onderwereld IFM (NL), Future Intel (NL), Operator (NL), Station Station (FR), Radio Vilnius (LT). Her music was released with clipp.art (AU), Onderwereld (NL), Too Soon tapes (FR). Her tracks to be released on these labels: Onrijn records (NL), Abstract Reality (FR), V.E.N.T. (TR), Flippen Disks (NL).</br>
            She is also a member of “The North Sea Wolf Pack”, where together with other female musicians and artists from The Hague/Rotterdam she creates, collaborates and brings out music.
